#2. Write a program to find out whether a student has passed or failed if it requires a
#total of 40% and at least 33% in each subject to pass. Assume 3 subjects and
#take marks as an input from the user.

sub1 = int(input('enter marks 1: '))
sub2 = int(input('enter marks 2: '))
sub3 = int(input('enter marks 3: '))



#check for total percentage
total_percentage = 100* (sub1 + sub2 + sub3) / 300 

if(total_percentage >= 40 and sub1 >= 33 and sub2 >= 33 and sub3 >= 33):
    print('you are pass', total_percentage)
else:
    print('you failed , try again next year' , total_percentage)
